// Before we move on to why functional components are stateless, we need to understand what a state is.

import { useState } from "react";

// In simple terms, a state is a JavaScript object in React used to represent information about a 
// componentâ€™s current situation. Its scope is inside a particular component, 
// and it is used for internal communication inside a component. 

// In React, functional components can have a concept similar to states by using hooks.

// Hooks in Functional Components
// if we wanted to add a state to a functional component, the only way to do that was to convert
// it to a class component. Hooks are a recently added feature in React that allows us to use all 
// React features without writing class components. 

// Now, there are two rules to use hooks:

// 1. We cannot call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
// 2. Hooks can only be called from functional components in React and not any JavaScript function.
